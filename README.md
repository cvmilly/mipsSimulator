# mipsSimulator
simulator written for a subset of the MIPS instruction set

Once the instructions and data is read, this simulator will commence from the very first instruction written within the machine code file and will continue until it encounters a syscall that exits. The log master text file is the file in which all of the details of the simulation prints out. This log includes disassembled instructions and the initial values of the data memory. Each time an instruction is executed, the disassembled instruction is printed along with the current values or the registers and of the words in the data segment of memory. 

- this simulator was created as a result of a comp org II assignment -
